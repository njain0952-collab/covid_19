🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to understand the spread of the virus, recovery trends, and mortality patterns across different regions. The analysis was performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases

Identify trends and waves of COVID-19 over time

Compare country-wise and region-wise impact

Visualize data using static and interactive charts

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib (static visualizations)

Plotly (interactive visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook

ZIP files (raw data storage)
